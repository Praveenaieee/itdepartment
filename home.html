        <h2> IT PROGRAM OUTCOMES</h2><br>
        <p><strong>
        1. Engineering knowledge: Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization<br> 
        to the solution of complex engineering problems.<br><br>
        2. Problem analysis: ldentify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated<br>
        conclusions using first principles of mathematics,natural sciences, and engineering sciences.<br><br>
        3. Design/development of solutions: Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that<br>
        meet the specified needs with appropriateconsideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural,societal, and environmental
         considerations.<br><br>
        4. Conduct investigations of complex problems: Use research-based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, <br>
        analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions.<br><br>
        5. Modern tool usage: Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including<br>
         prediction and modelling to complex engineering activitieswith an understanding of the limitations.<br><br>
        6.The engineer and society: Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and <br>
        cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice.<br><br>
        7. Environment and sustainability: Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental <br>
        contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development.<br><br>
